        Gir Forest National Park is a wildlife sanctuary in Gujarat, western
        India. It was established to protect Asiatic lions, who frequent the
        fenced-off Devalia Safari Park, along with leopards and antelopes.

        Gir Jungle Trail, outside the fenced area, traverses deciduous forest
        and is home to wildlife including vultures and pythons. The Kamleshwar
        Dam has marsh crocodiles and birds, such as Indian skimmers and
        pelicans.
