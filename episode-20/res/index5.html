            Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi (Vināyaka Caturthī), 
            or Vinayaka Chaviti (Vināyaka Cavitī) is a Hindu festival celebrating the arrival of 
            Shri Ganesh Ji to earth from Kailash Parvat with his mother Goddess Parvati/Gauri. 
            The festival is marked with the installation of Lord Ganesh's clay murtis privately in homes 
            and publicly by Shri Bal Gangadhar Tilak popularly known as Lokmanya Tilak in Pune in the year 1893 
            on elaborate pandals (temporary stages). Observations include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts 
            such as, prayers and vrata (fasting). Offerings and prasāda from the daily prayers, that are distributed 
            from the pandal to the community, include sweets such as modaka as it is believed to be a favourite of 
            Lord Ganesh. The festival ends on the tenth day after start, when the idol is carried in a public procession 
            with music and group chanting, then immersed in a nearby body of water such as a river or sea. In Mumbai alone, 
            around 150,000 statues are immersed annually. Thereafter the clay idol dissolves and Lord Ganesh is believed 
            to return to Mount Kailash to Parvati and Shiva. The festival celebrates Lord Ganesh as the God of New 
            Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles as well as the God of wisdom and intelligence and is observed 
            throughout India, especially in the states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, 
            Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Goa, West Bengal, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu. Ganesh Chaturthi 
            is also observed in Nepal and by the Hindu diaspora elsewhere such as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, 
            Singapore, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, other parts of the Caribbean, Fiji, Mauritius, 
            South Africa, United States, and Europe. In the Gregorian calendar, Ganesh Chaturthi falls between 
            22 August and 20 September every year.

            At public venues, along with the reading of texts and group feasting, athletic and martial arts competitions are also held.
